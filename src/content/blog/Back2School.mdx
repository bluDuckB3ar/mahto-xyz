## Going Back in 2024

In 2024, I decided to go back to school and jump fully into IT and cybersecurity with WGU's Cybersecurity and Information Assurance program. It felt like the right time to stop dabbling and actually commit to a real path in tech.

Starting school again after some time away was a mix of excitement and anxiety. But once the classes kicked in and the material started to click, it confirmed that this is where I want to be.

## Getting My A+ (And How Different It Felt)

One of the first big milestones on this journey was earning my CompTIA A+ certification, which felt way different compared to the older 901/902 versions people used to talk about. The newer objectives lean more into modern hardware, operating systems, and real-world troubleshooting scenarios.

To prepare, I leaned hard on **Professor Messer's** free videos, mainly from his YouTube channel and website:

- Website: https://www.professormesser.com [web:19]  

I also used **Jason Dion's** Udemy courses and practice exams, which helped reinforce the material with lots of hands-on-style questions and detailed explanations:

## Looking Ahead: Net+ and Sec+

Now that A+ is done, the next targets on my list are **CompTIA Network+** and **CompTIA Security+**. Network+ will help me lock in how networks really work under the hood, which is crucial for understanding almost any security issue.

Security+ comes after that and is often treated as a baseline cybersecurity certification for many entry-level and SOC roles, so having both gives me a clear roadmap for the next phase of my journey.

## Diving Into TCM Security and SOC

On top of the more traditional certs, I've been exploring **TCM Security's** SOC-focused courses and certifications, which are very hands-on and geared toward real-world blue-team work:

I'm still deciding which TCM certifications I want to commit to long term, but it's motivating to see training that focuses so much on practical labs, real tooling, and workflows similar to what SOC analysts use on the job [web:1][web:5].

## Falling in Love with Malware Triage

One thing that has surprised me the most is how much I'm enjoying the **Practical Malware Analysis & Triage (PMAT)** course from TCM Security. The course walks through building a safe malware lab, doing static and dynamic analysis, and writing detections and triage reports based on real-world samples [web:6][web:24].  

The PMAT course details and enrollment page are here:

Working through those labs has made me seriously consider leaning more toward malware analysis or incident response roles in the future. It's one of those parts of cybersecurity that really grabs my attention and makes me want to keep pushing deeper into the technical side of the field.
